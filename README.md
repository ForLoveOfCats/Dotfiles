# My Dotfiles

Currently contains my Emacs and Fish configs. Nothing *to* interesting
here. Beware `init.el` though, it is rather messy and lived in.

Putting one's dotfiles in a public repo feels a bit egotistical but I
*have* been asked for my Emacs config specifically so it has proven
handy to have a repo to point to.
